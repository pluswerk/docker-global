# Docker-Global

Docker Global Setup makes it much easier to develop websites. This bundles the most important services into a single package using [Docker](https://docker.com).

The individual websites then still need the [pluswerk/php-dev](https://github.com/pluswerk/php-dev) package and that's all.

This setup is extensible and well customizable for the individual needs of a project.

## Requirements

You need [Docker](https://docker.com) and a few free ports, depending on whether you want to customize it even further.

* [Docker](https://docker.com)
* Free Ports: 80, 443, 1025, 3306

## Setup steps

Before you start the setup you need to stop all processes what block ports 80, 443, 1025, 3306.

````bash
git clone git@github.com:pluswerk/docker-global.git global
cd global
# always start it with this command(if it is not running already):
bash start.sh start
````

These Environment variables are required for docker-global to start.

````bash
TLD_DOMAIN=vm23.your.tld
HTTPS_MAIN_DOMAIN=vm23.your.tld
DNS_CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL=cloudflare@yourmail
DNS_CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY=0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
````

Go to your Portainer URL and create a user.

Configure Portainer:

* Settings > Authentification > Session lifetime = 1 year

## https

We use [kanti/local-https](https://github.com/Kanti/local-https) for our certificate generation:

If you want HTTPS for your setup you need to set this ENV variables: (in `.env`)

````bash:
# required:
HTTPS_MAIN_DOMAIN=your.tld
DNS_CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL=cloudflare@yourmail
DNS_CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY=0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

# optional:
SLACK_TOKEN=111111111/222222222/333333333333333333333333
````

## .env file | Customize

You can create a `.env` file and overwrite some Settings:

````bash
# restart global containers? https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#restart
RESTART=always
# host ports: You can change the ports without breaking php-dev installations. (maybe if you change 80 or 443)
HTTP_PORT=80
HTTPS_PORT=443
DB_PORT=3306
SMTP_PORT=1025
````
