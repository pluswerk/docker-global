# Docker-Global

Docker Global Setup makes it much easier to develop websites. This bundles the most important services into a single package using [Docker](https://docker.com).

The individual websites then still need the [PHP-DEV](https://github.com/pluswerk/php-dev) package and that's all.

This setup is extensible and well customizable for the individual needs of a project.

## Requirements

You need [Docker](https://docker.com) and a few free ports, depending on whether you want to customize it even further.

* [Docker](https://docker.com)
* Ports: 80, 443, 3306

## Documentation

See the [Documentation](docs/index.md) of this Setup System.
